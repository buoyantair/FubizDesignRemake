This project has given me a lot of insight on how some things work. I will keep learning about design, abstraction and science. :) 

## Features
- Users are able to view blogposts on the front page with their authors and a special blog-specific image. 
- Users are able to toggle a simple navigation bar which consists of the website/blog information as well as website menu. The navigation bar also has social media links.
- Responsive web design is applied to make sure that the user gets the best experience in pretty much every modern device.
